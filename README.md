Raven's Progressive Matrices
============================

We want to implement a version of the Raven's Progressive Matrices (RPM) test to apply on children; and generate not only _g_-factors but also electroencephalographic data from them, so we can analyze how children take decisions during these tests. It's currently implemented on E-prime and on C#, with the later containing its own data analysis suite.
